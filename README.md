# Inheritance
## What is Inheritance?
In object-oriented programming (OOP), Inheritance allows one class (child class or subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (parent class or superclass). 
This helps in code reuse, allowing the child class to use the functionality of the parent class, and modify or extend it as needed.
In Java, we use the keyword extends to establish inheritance.

## Key Concepts:
**Parent Class (Superclass)**: This is the class that provides the fields and methods to be inherited.
**Child Class (Subclass)**: This is the class that inherits from the parent class. It can add its own fields and methods or override inherited methods.
**Method Overriding**: This allows the child class to provide its specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.
**super Keyword**: Used to access parent class methods or constructors from the child class.
**this Keyword**: Refers to the current instance of the class.

## Step-by-Step Example with Detailed Explanations
### 1. Define the Parent Class
The parent class is the Employee class. It has basic properties such as name and position, as well as a method displayDetails() to print these details.
```bash
// Parent class
class Employee {
    String name;
    String position;

    // Constructor for the parent class (Employee)
    Employee(String name, String position) {
        this.name = name;  // `this.name` refers to the instance variable of the class
        this.position = position; // `this.position` refers to the instance variable of the class
    }

    // Method to display details of the employee
    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee: " + name);
        System.out.println("Position: " + position);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The Employee class is the parent class.
Constructor: This is used to initialize the name and position of the employee. The constructor uses this to refer to the instance variables of the class.
Method displayDetails(): This prints the name and position of the employee.

### 2. Define the Child Class (Doctor)
Now, we define the Doctor class that inherits from Employee. The Doctor class has an additional property: specialization. It also overrides the displayDetails() method 
to add more specific information.

```bash
// Child class (Doctor inherits from Employee)
class Doctor extends Employee {
    String specialization;

    // Constructor for Doctor class
    Doctor(String name, String position, String specialization) {
        super(name, position);  // Calling the parent constructor to initialize name and position
        this.specialization = specialization; // Initializing the specialization of the doctor
    }

    // Overriding the displayDetails method for Doctor
    @Override
    void displayDetails() {
        super.displayDetails(); // Calling the parent method (Employee's displayDetails)
        System.out.println("Specialization: " + specialization); // Adding doctor's specialization
    }
}
```

## Changing Method Behavior in Overriding
```bash
// Parent class
class Employee {
    String name;
    String position;

    // Constructor
    Employee(String name, String position) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
    }

    // Method to display details
    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Position: " + position);
    }
}

// Child class (Doctor inherits from Employee)
class Doctor extends Employee {
    String specialization;

    // Constructor
    Doctor(String name, String specialization) {
        super(name, "Doctor"); // Position is always "Doctor"
        this.specialization = specialization;
    }

    // Overriding the displayDetails method to completely change its behavior
    @Override
    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Meet Dr. " + name + "!");
        System.out.println("Specialty: " + specialization);
        System.out.println("Dr. " + name + " is an expert in " + specialization + ".");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee("John Doe", "Manager");
        emp.displayDetails();

        System.out.println(); // Line break for clarity

        Doctor doc = new Doctor("Smith", "Cardiology");
        doc.displayDetails(); // Calls the overridden method
    }
}

```
Explanation:
The Doctor class is the child class that extends Employee. It inherits name and position from Employee and adds a specialization field.
Constructor: The Doctor constructor calls the parent class constructor using super(name, position), passing the name and position parameters. 
This ensures that the Employee class is initialized first.
Method Overriding: The Doctor class overrides the displayDetails() method. By calling super.displayDetails(), the child class uses the Employee class‚Äôs displayDetails() method to print 
the common details, and then adds its own details like the doctor's specialization.

### 3. Using super and this
**super():** Refers to the parent class‚Äôs constructor and is used to initialize the parent class's fields.
**super.displayDetails()**: Calls the parent class's method. In this case, we want to reuse the displayDetails() method from Employee, and then we add more functionality 
specific to the Doctor class.

### 4. Testing in the Main Class
Finally, we use the Doctor class in the Main class to create a new Doctor object and display the details.
```bash
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a Doctor object
        Doctor doc = new Doctor("Dr. Smith", "Doctor", "Surgeon");
        doc.displayDetails(); // Calling the displayDetails method
    }
}
```
Explanation:
Creating the Doctor object: We create an instance of the Doctor class and pass the name, position, and specialization as arguments.
Calling displayDetails(): We call the displayDetails() method, which will first display the common details from the Employee class and then the specific details from the Doctor class.

### Expected Output:
```bash
Employee: Dr. Smith
Position: Doctor
Specialization: Surgeon
```

### BReakdown of what happened
The Doctor object is created, which calls the Doctor constructor.
The Doctor constructor calls the Employee constructor via super(name, position), initializing name and position for the employee.
The displayDetails() method in Doctor is called. It first invokes super.displayDetails() to print the employee details, then prints the doctor‚Äôs specialization.

### Summary of Key Concepts in Inheritance
Inheritance allows a subclass (child class) to inherit properties and methods from a superclass (parent class).
The super keyword is used to refer to the parent class, either to call a constructor or a method.
The this keyword is used within the class to refer to the current instance.
Method Overriding allows the child class to modify or extend the functionality of a method inherited from the parent class.
Constructors ensure that both parent and child classes are properly initialized.
